# Spotify-Weekly
Application to pick up your Spotify weekly songs and add them to a playlist!

I got really caught up with work and my ritual of updating my current playlist with the weekly recomms got missed thrice. Modern problems require a tech solution and here it is. 
A cron job to run this microservice would do the magic by religiously backing up the Spotify weekly picks for you to get back to whenever you want!
